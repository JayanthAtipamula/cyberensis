## Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT)

Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT) aims to find security vulnerabilities which allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or disrupt the performance of an application or website.

Nowadays, Organizations moving their most operational, critical business and applications process on the web environment.

If any web applications have any kind of loopholes or vulnerabilities, they may result in credit card stealing, sensitive data of users, reputational and financial damage of an organization.

During the intense competition in the market, Keeping the critical and sensitive information of an organization safe and secure, is meant to be most important. Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT) will sort the security issues of all your web applications and evaluate the risk.

Web Applications Penetration Testing (WAPT) will follow the context of testing according to good practices of the industry such as the OWASP testing Methodology. In addition to the OWASP, we are offering additional testing processes by our research into application security vulnerabilities and for revealing security flaws.

#### Why your organization requires Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT)

Web Applications are very critical aspect of an organization, they perform activities like storing information, processing data and transmitting data. Every device connected to the Internet is vulnerable. An attacker who finds the vulnerability in your organization's Web application may exploit it and steal your company Sensitive and confidential information.

#### So How Secure your Network and Web application is…?

How widely your Web Application has been tested to expose these flaws before the malicious attacker finds them.

Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT) is essential, in order to assess these security flaws in your web applications.

#### Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT) includes:

Testing Authentication mechanism for flaws that could allow an attacker to get unauthorized access to authenticated areas of the application

Testing Authorization to find permission flaws around access to functionality or data

Ensures the strong encryption of the application

Assessment of the application for flaws that could be exploited to manipulate and modify the information or stealing information from database queries, executing malicious commands and web pages.

To build secure server environments with secure configuration

### Process of Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT)

#### Information Gathering

To perform Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT), the tester will collect information by several informational tools or manual surfing on publicly accessible information regards to the client which can exploit to gain access to the system. The tester employs multiple tools for understanding the software systems in a network.

#### Planning and Research

Next step after Collecting information with tools and surfing forwarded to planning thorough research. Planning is to define penetration testing objectives.

#### Vulnerability Assessment (VA)

Testers will examine and understand the request and response of a target app to several intrusion attacks. To examine such attacks, testers may use static or dynamic analysis. A formal way of testing method is to check whether the application code is behaving in the way it was designed or not, later inspection of code and an other method to find vulnerabilities takes place.

#### Penetration Testing (PT)

Pen-testing involves utilizing different types of web application attacks like cross-site scripting, SQL injection, other security vulnerabilities for uncovering a targeted vulnerability. Then pen-testers try to exploit these vulnerabilities to understand the impact that they cause.

#### Report and Analysis

The Test results are merged and assembled into the report that briefs the sensitive data accessed and particular vulnerabilities exploited. The report is analysed by the security professionals to create strong safety resolutions.

### Benefits of Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT)
